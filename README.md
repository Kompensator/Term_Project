*Purpose: Binary star system simulation, with possibility to simulate the N-Body problem, using Verlet's method
*Languages used: Java 8, Python 3
*Dependencies: Numpy and Matplotlib for Python 3 (Anaconda 3 recommended) 
*run.sh and run.bat will simplify the entire compiling, simulating and animating process
*To manually compile and run the code:
1. `javac -d . Body.java`
2. `javac VerletCollision.java`
3. `java VerletCollision`
4. `python animate_collision.py`
