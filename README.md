* Purpose: Binary star system simulation, with possibility to simulate the N-Body problem, using Verlet's method
* Languages used: Java 8, Python 3.7
* Dependencies: Numpy and Matplotlib for Python 3 (Anaconda 3 installation recommended)
* You may have to create empty .data files for Verlet to write to it
* run.sh and run.bat will simplify the entire compiling, simulating and animating process
* To manually compile and run the code:

1. `javac VerletCollision.java`
2. `java VerletCollision`
3. `python animate_collision.py`
